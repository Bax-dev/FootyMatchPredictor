#FootyMatchPredictor
Predict the outcome of football matches using historical data with the power of machine learning!

#Features:
Data Preprocessing: Categorical variables are encoded, and missing values are handled seamlessly.
Model Training: Uses a Random Forest Classifier to train the model on historical match data.
Performance Evaluation: The model's accuracy is measured, and confusion matrices are plotted to visualize performance.
Feature Importance: Identify the most influential factors in predicting match outcomes.
Visualization: Confusion matrices and feature importance plots are generated for better insights.


About

#Getting Started
Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib matplotlib seaborn

Run the script:

python predict.py
Customize: Replace the file_path variable with your dataset path to use your own data.

How It Works
The model takes historical match data, encodes teams and results, and predicts the outcome of future matches. With a focus on English Premier League (EPL) data, the model achieves robust performance, which can be visualized through confusion matrices and feature importance charts.
